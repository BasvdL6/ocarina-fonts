# Ocarina fonts
Ocarina TwelveH Alpha is a Unicode typeface that supports all standard fingerings for a twelve hole ocarina, 
mapped to A-U or a-u. Additionally, some symbols that might be useful are mapped to V-Z or v-z.

In the future, I'm planning to create a second font following the same mapping scheme as this font: https://whirlwindpress.ca/collections/frontpage/products/ocarina-fingering-diagram-font.
